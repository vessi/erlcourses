Let's spawn some processes. This is `hello_server.erl`, our precisious server.

```erlang
-module(hello_server).
-export([loop/0]).

loop() ->
  loop().
```

Now let's compile and spawn it!

```erlang-repl

## Spawn

Spawn knows about other nodes. You can spawn function on other node. 

Launch node 1:
```shell
node1> erl -sname node1 -setcookie secret
```
Launch node 2:
```shell
node2> erl -sname node2 -setcookie secret
```

On node1:

On node2:

Your first semi-distributed app is ready! But don't shut down nodes, we'll need them.

On node 1:
```erlang-repl

{hello, world}

On node 2 take PID from `i().` output and:
```erlang-repl
2> Pid = list_to_pid("<0.72.0>").
<0.72.0>
3> process_info(Pid, message_queue_len).
{message_queue_len,1}

So we need not only receive messages but also fetch them. We can do it by tricky way like

```erlang
Mailbox = process_info(self(), messages),
[H|T] = Mailbox. % KILL ME PLS
```
---
# Processes
## Messages (receiving)

But on last lecture we have learnt less tricky way, the glorious `receive` function. So let's create `com_server.erl`

```erlang
-module(com_server).
-export([listen/0]).

listen() ->
  receive
    {hello, Name} ->
      io:format("Hello, ~s~n", [Name]),
      listen();
    {bye, Name} ->
      io:format("Bye, ~s~n", [Name]),
      listen();
    _ ->
      listen()
  end.
```

This will create `listen` loop.

*Special note*. Can you find more DRY way to do this?

# Processes
## Messages (receiving)

Let's try spawn our process and send message to it.

```erlang-repl
1> c(com_server).
{ok, com_server}
2> Pid = spawn(fun com_server:listen/0).
<0.71.0>
3> Pid ! "World".
Hello, World
ok
```

Sometimes you need to pass some of messages first and all other after. This is the way how it's implemented in `selective.erl`

```erlang
-module(selective).
-export([important/0]).

important() ->
  receive
    {Priority, Message} when Priority > 10 ->
      [Message | important()]
    after 0 ->
      normal()
  end.
 
normal() ->
  receive
    {_, Message} ->
      [Message | normal()]
    after 0 ->
      []
  end.
```
---
# Processes
## Selective receive

Let's take a look, how it works.

```erlang-repl
1> c(selective).
{ok,selective}
2> self() ! {15, high}, self() ! {7, low}, self() ! {1, lowest}, self() ! {17, highest}.
{17,high}
3> process_info(self(), messages).
{messages,[{15,high},{7,low},{1,lowest},{17,highest}]}
4> selective:important().
[high,highest,low,lowest]
```

*Special note:* Please rewrite this module to take care of ranges of priorities without numbers, just by atoms:

* lowest
* low
* high
* highest

Sometimes it's needed to know when your spawned process crashed. That's why process links exists. Take a look at module `linked.erl`

```erlang
-module(linked).
-export([chain/1]).

chain(0) ->
  receive
    _ -> ok
  after 2000 ->
    exit("chain dies here")
  end;
chain(N) ->
  Pid = spawn(fun() -> chain(N-1) end),
  link(Pid),
  receive

  end.

## Linked processes

Let's test it in the shell.

```erlang-repl
1> c(linked).
{ok,linked}
2> link(spawn(linked, chain, [3])).
true
** exception error: "chain dies here"
```

What happened here? `chain(3)` linked `chain(2)`, `chain(2)` linked `chain(1)`, `chain(1)` linked `chain(0)`. `chain(0)` received timeout and thrown exception. It was populated upper and upper because of link, so all chains died up to shell. Shell was restarted by supervisor.
